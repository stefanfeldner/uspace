# uspace - your source of updates, information, and memories!

Imagine a place where everyone can share news on what's going on in their lives, notes on the latest class, or, if you're a company, share the progress, on a new product or service.

uspace is here to help with that by letting you create your **own unique spaces** where you can share all those pieces of information quickly and easily.

It allows users to either login or create a new account using **aut0** for authentication.

After logging in, you arrive at the **spaces** page, showing you all the spaces you created and all the spaces other users created. You can filter these spaces using the input form on top, to help you find the space you're looking for, it helps you with autocompletion.

Once you have found the space you want to visit, click on it, and you'll see all the posts that the owner created. These posts are sorted by creation date and will always show you the newest post up top. If you are the owner of the space, you can create new posts and delete existing ones. Posts can have tags, and you can filter the posts based on multiple tags up here. If you want, you can also leave some comments on the posts.
